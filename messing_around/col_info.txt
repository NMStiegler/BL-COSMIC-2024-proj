    signal_frequency: The frequency the top-hit starts at
    signal_index: Which frequency bin the top-hit starts at. This is relative to the coarse channel.
    signal_drift_steps: How many bins the top-hit drifts over. This counts the drift distance over the full rounded-up power-of-two time range.
    signal_drift_rate: The drift rate in Hz/s
    signal_snr: The signal-to-noise ratio for the top-hit
    signal_coarse_channel: Which coarse channel this top-hit is in
    signal_beam: Which beam this top-hit is in. -1 for incoherent beam, or no beam
    signal_num_timesteps: The number of timesteps in the associated filterbank. This does *not* use rounded-up-to-a-power-of-two timesteps.
    signal_power: The total power that is normalized to calculate snr. snr = (power - median) / stdev
    signal_incoherent_power: The total power for the same signal, calculated incoherently. This is available in the stamps files, but not in the top-hits files.
