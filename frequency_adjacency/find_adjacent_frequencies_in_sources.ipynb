    "If a source records two hits at exactly the same frequency but at two different times, we can be somewhat certain this is RFI because we think real ET signals will drift due to the doppler shifting of light based on differing accelerations between the cosmic motions of the Earth, the Sun, and the transmitting source. It would be super unlikely for these two accelerations to exactly sync up, and unless the ET source was directing a signal at Earth and deliberately trying to correct for this doppler drift with their transmission (meaning they're transmiting directly to the Earth itself directly), there will be some drift. However, with COSMIC, we can't make cuts based on a 0 drift rate signal because our resolution to detecting drift rate isn't sensitive enough to tell the difference between something drifting at a rate of 0.0000001 Hz/s (RFI likely) or something more like 0.1 Hz/s (note the smallest magnitude nonzero drift rate in the coherent hits is 0.242531920 Hz/s). However, we can artificially increase our sensitivity to low (zero) drift rates by looking for the same signal across multiple times of observation. If we see multiple hits across time at exactly the same frequencies (or within a small narrow band), then it's likely RFI."
