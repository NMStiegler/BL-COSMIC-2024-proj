# BL-COSMIC-2024-proj

An assortment of compiled work from the Berkeley SETI 2024 REU Intern program with the Breakthrough Listen group. Specifically, work with the COSMIC group which conducts commensal observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array telescope in New Mexico.

At the moment, a place to compile and save work. Additional documentation to be added in the future.

Files:
- messing_around.ipynb: A notebook to begin working with hits from the COSMIC pipeline marked by SETIcore at frequencies between 25-50GHz
- messing_around_focused.ipynb: A notebook for messing around with techniques for finding which hits can be flagged as RFI and ignored
- trim_dataset.py: A script for trimming off unnecessary columns from the dataset (pulled from the database) and partitioning it by observation type
