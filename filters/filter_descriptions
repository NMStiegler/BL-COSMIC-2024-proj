Coherent:
1. Grouped by source. Grouped by frequency. Rejects groups where all hits have 0 drift rate
2. Grouped by source. Grouped by frequency. Rejects groups where all hits have drift rate < 0.25Hz/s
3. Grouped by source. Grouped by frequency. Rejects groups where all hits have drift rate < 2Hz/s
4. Grouped by source. Grouped by frequency. Rejects groups with more than one frequency
5. Grouped by freuqency. Rejects groups with more than one frequency.
6. Rejects all hits with zero drift rate.
7. Rejects all hits with SNR < 10
8. Rejects all hits with SNR > 100
9. Rejects hits within 2hz of another hit
10. Rejects hits within 10hz of another hit
11. Flag hits which have another hit where it looks like they're drifting to
12. For timestamps which have a num_timesteps < 16, reject hits with SNR < 15
