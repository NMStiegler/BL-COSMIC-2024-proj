Filter 1 takes out all the hits which look like RFI because they're
observed in the same patch of sky (on the same target) multiple times
at exactly the same frequency and each time with a zero drift rate.
The zero drift rate means signals are not accelerating relative to
the telescope, which means they're probably on the Earth (not ET)
